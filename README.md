# The-Ultimate-Unit-Converter
A fun unit conversion program to assists people at time of need.
Built using Eclipse.

Many people struggle with different unit conversions. It could be during shopping, school or when travelling. 
I created a program that allows different unit conversions in a very simple and interactive way.

To run: Open all files, and run the Starter.java file.
